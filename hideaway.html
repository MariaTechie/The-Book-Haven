            <h2>Hideaway</h2>
            <p>Hideaway is the second book in the dark romantic suspense series <span class="highlight">Devil’s Night by Penelope Douglas.</span> 
                <br> I absolutely recommend reading the first book, <span class="highlight"> Corrupt</span>, prior to reading this one because it a true continuation of the series, and is not a stand alone, despite focusing on different main characters than book one.  If you read this book first you will likely feel confused and it will spoil book one. Also, as this is a dark romance, basically the whole entire thing is triggering.
               <br> Hideaway is actually my favorite so far in the whole series. By the way, Penelope Douglas is my favorite author! I wouldn't stop recommending her books; she's absolutely awesome. <span class = " highlight">Spoiler alert!</span> <br>
               First, I'd like to talk a bit about the characters, especially the female main character, <span class = " highlight">Banks.</span> 
               <br>She's <span class = "highlight">Damon's</span> sister, and unlike <span class = "highlight">Rika</span>, she's more confident.
                <br> I wouldn't say rude, but she's a badass, just like her brother. 
                <br>I just loved her and admire her so much; she's the smartest of all the Cowgirls. We also have <span class = 'highlight'>Kai</span>. Although we didn't get that much of Banks's relationship with Kai, I really liked him. 
                <br>He's the smartest of them all. I really like their relationship; it's the kind of forbidden love, like the trope of 'don't fall for your brother's best friend,' and I like that trope. Also, another thing I'd like to add is that Damon is very possessive of his sister.
                <br> He didn't want anyone to have her except himself.
                <br> She was his safe place, and you can get glimpses of their relationship while reading the book, and believe me, you will absolutely love it! Fun fact: I have something in common with Banks—we both hate <span class =' highlight'>Michael.</span>
            </p>
