            <h2>The Wrong Bride</h2>
            <p><span class ="highlight">"The Wrong Bride"</span> shattered me completely. It's the ultimate heartbreak story. <span class ="highlight">Raven, a model,</span> is secretly <span class ="highlight">in love</span> with <span class ="highlight">Ares</span>, a rich guy. He was about to marry her, but then he fell in love with her celebrity sister. Years later, he's set to marry the sister, but she jilts him at the altar. Raven marries him instead to salvage their families' business deal, even though he's still in love with her sister. Can you believe it?

                Ares is a nice guy, he's kind to Raven, despite his heart being elsewhere. Raven, however? My heart ached for her. <span class ="highlight">She has been through hell.</span> Her family essentially didn't want her, and she always had to live in her sister's shadow. <span class ="highlight">As Billie Eilish sings, "If teardrops could be bottled, there'd be swimming pools filled with models."</span> That lyric is exactly Raven's life. She just hoped Ares would actually love her, but he was blind. 
                
                And her sister? Ugh. She was awful. Selfish, fame-obsessed, and mean. She even tried to ruin Raven's career! Raven deserved so much better. I was hoping Ares would wake up and realize what he had in front of him. It's a book that will stay with you, that's for sure.
